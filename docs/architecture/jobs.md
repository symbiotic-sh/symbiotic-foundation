# Generic job store version 1 (proposal)

Following the lead's queue design §§13–14, version 1 provides atomic batch enqueue
with scoped keys, deduplication and key conflicts; claims with leases and
claim-generation fencing; completions with delivery leases and fenced Accepted
or Discarded confirmation; job/group cancellation; owner-tag erasure with a
sticky purged flag; live population/input/result bounds; bounded maintenance; transaction
participation; per-job lookup/status and paged Failed/Uncertain diagnostics.
Payloads and handler results are opaque bytes (`Vec<u8>` in memory, SQLite
`BLOB`), preserved exactly. Paid answers remain exclusively in the spend ledger;
the store retains only their receipt reference and reconciliation state.

Following §16, the claim is the handoff: one transaction marks the job Running
for its claim generation and returns its payload. The runner passes that payload
directly to the handler, with no entry lookup or snapshot checks. Cancellation
or owner erasure committed before the claim prevents it; after the claim, the
heartbeat signals the running handler. Erasure permits in-flight work to finish
but stores no output or recovery copy.

Handler execution is at least once: after a crash, an expired handler lease can
be claimed again. Handlers with external side effects must deduplicate by the
job's scoped key and claim generation, or fence downstream writes. The handler's
`JobContext::attempt` is its claim generation.

Later: admission attempts/notices → PR 4 (Memory egress); checkpoints → Warden adoption PR; cache-origin results → the caching consumer PR; priority/background share → the shared-scheduler consumer PR; group summaries/resumable rebuild → Memory adoption PR (D5b Q3).

The store uses `JobConfig` version 1 on SQLite only, including `:memory:` for
an in-memory runtime. Every default below is
**PROVISIONAL**; R9-D2 settles final values. Apps supply versioned configuration.

| Setting | Provisional default | Reason |
|---|---:|---|
| `max_live_jobs` | 1,024 | Bound pending, running (including Uncertain) and final-but-unconfirmed jobs. |
| `max_pending_bytes` | 16 MiB | Bound retained raw input bytes plus encoded metadata before writes. |
| `max_batch` | 64 | Bound atomic enqueue and confirmation requests. |
| `max_page` | 64 | Bound claim, delivery and diagnostic selections. |
| `max_page_bytes` | 1 MiB | Bound serialized candidate and completion arrays. |
| `max_result_bytes` | 16 MiB | Refuse larger raw handler results before commit. |
| `maintenance_bytes_per_pass` | 16 MiB | Bound raw payload/result bytes erased per expiry pass. |
| `claim_lease_seconds` | 30 seconds | Permit timely handler recovery after a lost worker. |
| `delivery_lease_seconds` | 30 seconds | Reduce overlap while retaining at-least-once delivery. |
| `maintenance_batch` | 64 | Bound each expiry pass. |
| `retention_seconds` | 7 days | Allow consumer recovery when no explicit result deadline is provided. |

Enqueue and claim use `(created_at, id)` order. Final delivery uses
`(finished_at, id)`; diagnostics use ascending IDs with exclusive cursors.
Owner erasure and group cancellation visit ascending IDs atomically.
SQL timestamps are INTEGER Unix
milliseconds within chrono's representable range; SQLite quantizes
ordinary clock precision to milliseconds and rejects leap seconds or overflowing
deadlines before commit.

Pending utilization is derived from unfinished canonical rows: raw payload
length plus the encoded metadata tuple `(scope, key, group, owners, kind,
execution, max_attempts)`. No pending-byte counter is stored.

Expiry processes jobs in `(recovery_until, id)` order, up to `maintenance_batch`
and `maintenance_bytes_per_pass`. The byte budget counts raw payload and result
copies erased by the pass. A nonempty pass always erases at least one job: a job
larger than the budget is erased alone. Subsequent jobs are deferred if they
would exceed the remaining budget; a pass stops when its budget is reached.
Unfinished jobs never expire solely because their recovery deadline passed.

Following §14, enqueue refuses new jobs with `QueueFull` at `max_live_jobs`;
replaying existing keys consumes no capacity. Claim, completion, recovery expiry
and owner erasure do not free population capacity: consumer confirmation does.
The live count is derived from the existing unfinished and unconfirmed-final
indexes. Lowering the bound refuses new work until enough jobs are confirmed;
existing work remains claimable, deliverable, confirmable and erasable.
Unconfirmed finals retain their partial delivery index; Failed/Uncertain
diagnostics retain their partial index. Owner membership is derived from
canonical owners in an indexed table and removed on confirmation. Erasure and
group cancellation process the bounded live population in one transaction.

Following §14 and the lead's settled tombstone decision, confirmation retains
only scoped identity, key, request digest, final state, disposition and receipt
reference, plus the latest delivery ordinal. The digest continues to reject
conflicting key replays; confirmation accepts only issued ordinals
`1..=delivery_generation`, including earlier deliveries after a lease expires.
All other job columns become SQL `NULL` and owner memberships are deleted in
the same transaction. The shared `JobRecord` read API supplies neutral values
for absent operational fields (empty/zero/false, absent options, Handler
execution and Unix epoch creation time); these defaults are not persisted.

Completion selection reads stored encoded result lengths and delivery metadata
before loading saved answers. The existing length column counts the serialized
byte-array representation for exact page preflight, while the result limit and
maintenance budget count raw bytes. Diagnostics and expiry maintenance use
content-free projections; expiry deletes copies directly. Encoded lengths and
all indexes are rebuildable from canonical rows. The unreleased SQLite schema
version is 14; older layouts are refused without migration.
